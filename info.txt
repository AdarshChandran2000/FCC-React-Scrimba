* u can easily add react to the html file by importing few scripts.
* this is easy way but not the normal and ideal way doing.

* why React? Its composable, its declarative, its a hirable skill, its actively maintained by skilled people


* The code we write inside ReactDOM.render is JSX (Javascript XML);
* if we try printing a JSX element, it will actually return a JS object. 
* images/react1.jpg
* make sure only one element is there in JSX, or else there will be error (wrap everything inside a DIV)

* ReactDOM.render only can render JSX. if u use .append() function, it ll only return an object.
 * React should be imported inorder for JSX to be return

* components are basically calling functions in react. use Pascalcase for components as convention and <Nav /> use this.

* export default Navbar;  ( default is used when only one function or variable is passed );
* the default extension for imports is .js, so you won't have to tell the extension specifically.
* npx create-react-app firstApp  // creates react app
* npm start //

    inline elements can be manipulated using display: inline-block , but won't have newline by default like block elements
    for hiding, there are 3 properties
    display: none;         // treats like object doesn't exist at all
    visibility: hidden;    // just hides it (position would be the same)
    opacity: 0;             //          ,,                ,,
