* u can easily add react to the html file by importing few scripts.
* this is easy way but not the normal and ideal way doing.

* why React? Its composable, its declarative, its a hirable skill, its actively maintained by skilled people


* The code we write inside ReactDOM.render is JSX (Javascript XML);
* if we try printing a JSX element, it will actually return a JS object. 
* images/react1.jpg
* make sure only one element is there in JSX, or else there will be error (wrap everything inside a DIV)

* ReactDOM.render only can render JSX. if u use .append() function, it ll only return an object.
 
 * React should be imported inorder for JSX to be return

* components are basically calling functions in react. use Pascalcase for components as convention and <Nav /> use this.
